**Name one of the key challenges for interactive information designers.**
Unlike graphic design, IID needs to work at a higher more abstract level. Such design needs to take into consideration the problem and opportunities of variable and changing data.

**Through reviewing the 'Bootcamp Bootleg' PDF choose one method and concisely explain the situation/circumstances where it would be most useful as a designer.**
 - Prototype method: getting ideas and explorations out of your head and into the physical world.
 - A designer will create a prototype which they deem to be creative and in visual form. It gives them the chance to express their thoughts and ideas.
 - This method can be particularly engaging for the people they are presenting their ideas to (whether its their teammates, clients or customers). It can be used to inspire others.
 - It can be a great way to have a different conversation with users.
 - Creating quich and dirty prototypes allows you to test a number of ideas without investing a lot of time and money up front.
