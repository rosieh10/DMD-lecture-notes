# Week 15 - Digital Media Pioneers

**Name three digital media pioneers mentioned in this week’s lecture.**
1. Charles Babbage (1791-1871)
2. Ada Lovelace (1815-1852)
3. Ben Laposky (1954-1956)

**Provide an explanation of their contribution and why it’s significant.**
1. He created a difference engine in 1832 which was a calculating machine and prototype for his later design of the Analytical Engine (which was never actually built)
2. She published an influential set of notes in 1843, which described the use of Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.
3. His work used oscilliscope (neither digital or a computer), however his use of them is significant in the way that he used technology for aesthetic, rather than computational ends.

**Name two practitioners mentioned in this week’s lecture whose work clearly straddles traditional art and science divides.**
1. Mary Coombs(1929- ) was a programmer for LEO, the Lyons Electronic Office that was the world's first business computer. Women were used for feminized clerical labor in the early 1900's, which many pervieve was masculine work.
2. Similarly, Daphne Oram (1925-2003) was the Optical Synthesiser Oramics Machine Electronic Music Pioneer in the 1960's. It was very traditional for women to have roles like this, which many people have often misconcieved women as uninterested or incapable in the field.
Fact: between 30 and 50% of programmers were women in the 1950's which was seen as a natural career for them

**Explain the significance of one of the cultural theories discussed in today’s lecture.**
In the 1980's, the personal computer became popular and heralded the stereotype of the programmer as an anti-social nerd. This was aided by the rise of Apple's Steve Jobs and Bill Gates as well as films such as War Games and Real Genius. 
It has been said that women pioneered computer programming , then the men took over their industry...
