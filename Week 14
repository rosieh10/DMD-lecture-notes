# Week 14 - Design Thinking

**Provide a concise summary of what Herbert Simon says about Design Thinking.**
in 1969 Herbert Simon's article 'Sciences of the artificial' described the word 'design' as the 'changing existing circumstances into preferred ones'. Design thinking is always linked to improving the future. It's a creative process, based on building ideas. 
Simons' basic steps that can be helpful for design thinking are:
1. Defining the problems
2. Research based on the questions who, what, where, when, why
3. Possible ideas that might lead to the solution
4. After trying these ideas, the best is chosen
5. The idea is implemented and evaluated

**Through referencing “The Cox Review of Creativity in Business”(2005) - why does its author - Sir George Cox believe Design Thinking is so important?**
Sir George Cox reviewed the "importance of creativity and innovation in business and how they can be a source of strength to successfully face the economic challenge. Baed on PricewaterhouseCoopers' Innovation survey, top innovators generate more thatn 75% of revenue from products that did not exist five years ago (Cox, 2005, p.11)." (Elmansy 2005, p.2)
"His observation indicates that creativity, design and innovation can help the UK's economy to maintain it's leadership in a competitive global market" (Elmansy 2005, p.3)
