**1. How do you see creativity?**
I see creativity as a way of expressing yourself as well as your interests, through your own interprestation. I believe that everyone sees creativity in their own unique ways. 

**2. What is the significance of ‘the problem’ for digital media designers?**
DMD focuses on the problem of communicating information and producing experiences for users e.g. websites, mobile apps and video games.

**3. What is the key to working effectively (individually and collaboratively)?**
Working effectively induvidually requires dedication and the ability to be resourceful when needed. Whereas, working collaboratively insists on you being inclusive and open with your ideas, as well as taking the time to evaluate others' ideas.

**4. What is design about?What are your aspirations for studying Digital Media Design?**
Design is about making the experience of interacting with content intuitive but it should also make it pleasureable. My aspirations in DMD are to express my creativity, by introducing new and unique ideas.

**5. How will you make the most of studying the Digital Media Design?**
I will ensure I am always fully engaged throughout the upcoming workshops and seminars, to ensure that I gain a vast understanding about what DMD has to offer and how it can be applied to the real world.

**6. Include a screen-shot of your Hi-Lo Game programming workshop exercise. 
In doing so, describe one aspect of what you found interesting or surprising about what you programmed 
(refer to specific line-numbers where relevant).**
I found creating this game very interesting as it is the first bit of coding that I have attempted. I found it surprisingly simple to code, as it only requires basic commands (func, string...)
