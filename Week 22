# Week 22 - Digital Product Design

**Name two concepts, which are key to both digital product design and physical product design.**
1. Formalism
2. User Centred design (UCD) 

**What do you understand by the concept of 'affordances'?**
They're an objects properties that suggest how the users may interact with that object. James Gibson's definition stated that all action possibilities are dependent on the users' physical abilities.

**What do you understand by the practice of Universal Design (and why it's important)?**
- When designing, users abilities are considered in the process. Their abilities may be complex and diverse, so it is important to ensure that the product design is relevant to everyone, not just one specific 'average' user.

**Name two people whose contributions have been significant for understanding digital product design.**
1. James Gibson: who developed the concept of affordances in the 1960's. He explained the way that things simultaneously enable and disable type of interaction and use.
2. Donald Norman: a pre-eminent interaction design and theorist, who explains affordances . He recognises the interrelatedness of formal and social/cultural technological affordances.

**Name one commonly used user-centred design (UCD) method/tool.**
UCD Personas: creating a user profile, to ensure that the designers know who they are creating the product for, as this concept is user-focused.

*How will you incoorporate this knowledge into your own app design?**
 - When designing my own app, I will create a UCD persona, to ensure that I know exactly who I'm creating it for and which elemnt need to be included to suit their preferences. This will ensure that my design is user-focused.
 - I will also consider the abilities of my users (Universal design), as I want to ensure that my app is appropriate for a diverse target audience.
